Summary:  
An electric analog computer has been constructed for a study of the kinetics
of catalase action. This computer gives results for the formation and
disappearance of the catalase-hydrogen peroxide complex that are in good
agreement with the experimental data. The computer study verifies an
approximate method for the computation of the velocity constant for the
combination of hydrogen peroxide and catalase and justifies the simple formula
used previously to compute the velocity constant for the reaction of the
catalase-hydrogen peroxide complex with donor molecules. Finally, the computer
data show that the binding of peroxide to catalase is a practically
irreversible reaction.

The reaction of the enzyme-substrate complex, p, with the electron donor, a,
is bimolecular, although in the article, as a is assumed to be constant, it is
modelled using an apparent rate constant consisting of the product of the rate
constant, k4, and the concentration of a. In this implementation, the
concentration of a is set to 1 and the value of k4 just adapted so that the
product equals the values given for k4*a in the article. The specific
parameter values are taken from Fig 3. The graphs do not exactly match those
in the paper, this _may_ be due to the different simulators used.
